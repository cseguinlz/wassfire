    "faqs_q1": "What kind of discounts can I expect from Wassfire deals?",
    "faqs_a1": "At Wassfire, we're committed to bringing you the most significant savings. That's why every deal we publish offers a discount of 40% or more. We believe in offering real value, so you can trust that the deals popping up on your phone are always worth a look.",

    "faqs_q2": "Does Wassfire sell products directly?",
    "faqs_a2": "No, Wassfire does not sell products directly. All the deals we share link directly to the original source, typically the brand's own ecommerce site. For example, if we share a deal on Adidas sneakers, you'll be directed to their official site like <a href='https://www.adidas.com/shoe-oznova/HP6364.html' target='_blank'>https://www.adidas.com/shoe-oznova/HP6364.html</a> to make your purchase. This way, you shop directly from the brands you love, ensuring authenticity and quality.",

    "faqs_q3": "Will following Wassfire fill my phone with SPAM?",
    "faqs_a3": "Absolutely not! Wassfire respects your privacy and your peace of mind. You can follow or unfollow our channels at any time. WhatsApp Channels are designed with privacy in mind, meaning your number and details remain invisible to us and other followers. Your interactions on our channel, like reactions or poll votes, are private, and only limited information is accessible to us as channel admins. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption ensures your personal messages stay private.",

    "faqs_q4": "How often does Wassfire update its deals?",
    "faqs_a4": "We update our channel three times per day to ensure you're always in the loop with the latest fashion deals.",

    "faqs_q5": "Why does Wassfire use URL shorteners for deal links?",
    "faqs_a5": "We use URL shorteners, like 'wass.promo/abc123', for a couple of important reasons. Firstly, it helps us keep the messages concise and focused on the deal itself. More importantly, it allows us to track clicks and understand which deals interest our followers most. This tracking is crucial for improving our service and ensuring we're always offering deals that excite and benefit you.",
